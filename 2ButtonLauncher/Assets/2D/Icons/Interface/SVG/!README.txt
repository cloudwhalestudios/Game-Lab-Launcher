IF YOU RUN INTO AN IMPORT ERROR ABOUT 'currentColor' NOT BEING SUPPORTER

1. open the svg with illustrator or a differetn svg tool
2. select all strokes and set their color again
3. save the file

alternatively you could just open the file with a text editor of your choice and look for the field "currentColor" and replace it with a stroke of your choice (hash code like "#000000" for black)

This should rewrite the 'currentcolor' option and remove the import error!
